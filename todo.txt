As a player, I want a persuer that flies ahead of me like the cops on need for speed 
    - drops mines that the player can collide with 
    - it is possible to kill the persuer by boosting, but not easy 
    - sometimes firies a missle 

As a player, I want cargo ships on straight lanes to provide a challenege
    - small ships fly to the middle of the lane  

As a player, I want the hitbox to match the image

As a player, I want to the missile to have a thruster effect
    -use an emitter or tack a truster on the bottom 
    - use the same as players?

As a player, I want a powertrust progress bar that looks good 
    - see if there is an open source progress bar that look good 
    - maybe the thruster could change color to show boost progress instead 
    - it should be obvious when at full power (pulse purple?)


As a player, I want a non-boost thruster that looks good 
    -animate existing thruster or find new one

As Greg McLean, I want a credits scene so I don't run into legal trouble for using open source art

    - resize images each playthrough
