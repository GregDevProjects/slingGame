-----------------Todo -----------------------------------------

As a player, I want to destroy asteroids with thrusters 
    -player gets thrust boost when asteroid is destroyed by thruster
    -asteroid tints as it takes damage (maybe)

-----------------Todo -----------------------------------------



-----------------Backlog -----------------------------------------

As a player, I want to be able to conserve momentum in wide areas when there isn't traffic 
    -give asteroids random sizes 
    -windmill thingy 
        - make it move slowly and take out obstacles in its path


As a player, I want to know when I'm grinding 
    -show emitter sparks on grind contact points 

As a player, I want differnt types of tracks 
    -see phone notes 

As a player, I want a non-boost thruster that looks good 
    -animate existing thruster or find new one

As a player, I want a powertrust progress bar that looks good 
    - see if there is an open source progress bar that look good 
    - maybe the thruster could change color to show boost progress instead 
    - it should be obvious when at full power (pulse purple?)

As a player, I want backgrounds with multiple layers 
    - the phaser 3 minimap delerium example shows this
    - add a few random planets 

As a player, I want a cap to the amount of asteroids/cargo ships that can be spawned at once
so that the game is fair (TUNING 1) 
    -implement cap per section size 

As a player, I want cargo ships that shoot each other (TUNING 2) 
    -starts at certain difficulty 

As a player, I want multiple types of obstacles in the same section (TUNING 3)
    -research how to implement based on difficulty 
    -implement in section 
    -deal with obstacles colliding

As a player, I want walls that aren't green
    -walls should change colors and/or texture on burst

As a player, I want a score system

As a player, I want the hitbox to match the image

-----------------Bugs -----------------------------------------

-asteroids spawn inside and beyond walls 
-collisions don't always register as expected 
    - use onstart and onactive for same collision detection

- sometimes when player is deleted

-----------------Ideas -----------------------------------------

-as a newgrounds player I need a challenege besides space rocks and taffic 
    -squad flyers 
        -fly in random patteren from bottom to top starting in a random X plane 

-make 1 variable for wallwidth

-As Greg McLean, I want my game to to have a retro asthetic 
    - music 
    - barriers 
    - space road  
-As a newgrounds user, I want to play an endless runner type game with a top down space ship 
    - highscores 
    - increasing difficulty
