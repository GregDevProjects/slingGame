As a player, I want cargo ships that warp in and out seamlessly 
    -cargo ships start with horizontal padding and fly in to regular spacing on an angle

As a player, I want to destroy asteroids with thrusters 
    -player gets thrust boost when asteroid is destroyed by thruster

As a player, I want to know when I'm grinding 
    -show emitter sparks on grind contact points 

As a player, I want a non-boost thruster that looks good 
    -animate existing thruster or find new one

As a player, I want a powertrust progress bar that looks good 
    - see if there is an open source progress bar that look good 
    - maybe the thruster could change color to show boost progress instead 
    - it should be obvious when at full power

As a player, I want backgrounds with multiple layers 
    - the phaser 3 minimap delerium example shows this

As a player, I want a cap to the amount of asteroids/cargo ships that can be spawned at once
so that the game is fair (TUNING 1) 
    -implement cap per section size 

As a player, I want multiple types of obstacles in the same section (TUNING 2)
    -research how to implement based on difficulty 
    -implement in section 
    -deal with obstacles colliding

As a player, I want a score system
