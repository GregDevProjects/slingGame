-----------------Todo -----------------------------------------

As a player, I want a training mode with pre selected sections to learn the game and 
get some sense of achievement 
    Levels 
        - straight line 
        - windy road with straight lines 
        - straight line with asteriods 
        - straight line with ships + asteroids 
        - windy road with missles  
        - open area with everything 

-----------------Todo -----------------------------------------



-----------------Backlog -----------------------------------------

As a player, I want cargo ships on straight lanes to provide a challenege
    - small ships fly to the middle of the lane  

As Greg McLean, I want my collision handling to make sense
    - refactor 
    - make sure walls are constantly colliding 

As a player, I want to know when I'm grinding 
    -show emitter sparks on grind contact points 

As a player, I want the hitbox to match the image

As a player, I want to the missile to have a thruster effect
    -use an emitter or tack a truster on the bottom 

As a player, I want a powertrust progress bar that looks good 
    - see if there is an open source progress bar that look good 
    - maybe the thruster could change color to show boost progress instead 
    - it should be obvious when at full power (pulse purple?)


As a player, I want a non-boost thruster that looks good 
    -animate existing thruster or find new one

As Greg McLean, I dont want to run into legal trouble for using open source art 
    - Add a credits scene where art authors are credited  
    - https://opengameart.org/content/missile-0 <- tell this dude about the game


As a player, I want a score system

As a player, I want a cool explosion effect for my ship
 - use particle burst 

As a player, I want to destroy asteroids with thrusters 
    -player gets thrust boost when asteroid is destroyed by thruster
    -asteroid tints as it takes damage (maybe)
    -asteroid get pushed instead of destroyed? 

As a player, I want each playthrough to have unique planet sizes  
    - resize images each playthrough 


-----------------Bugs -----------------------------------------

-asteroids spawn inside and beyond walls 

- random things explode (maybe fixed?)

- this could be fixed in .12
