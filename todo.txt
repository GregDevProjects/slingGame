    -----------------Levels -----------------------------------------

As a player, I want a persuer that flies ahead of me like the cops on need for speed 
    - drops mines that the player can collide with 
    - it is possible to kill the persuer by boosting, but not easy 
    - sometimes firies a missle 



As a player, I want the game to run smoothly as possible 
    -inventroy possible ways to boost preformance 
    -use event handlers instead of constant checks
